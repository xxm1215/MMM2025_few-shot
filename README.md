# Multimodal Few-Shot Learning with Prompt-Based Sentiment Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a multimodal few-shot learning framework using prompt-based methods for sentiment analysis and fake news detection. The project is structured to handle image and text data using multimodal fusion techniques.

## File Structure

- **`multimodal_prompt_fewshot_lxr.py`**: The main program that runs the core functionality of multimodal prompt-based learning. This script handles the loading of data, model training, and prediction.
  
- **`main.sh`**: A shell script that serves as the entry point to the project. Execute this script to initiate the full process including data loading, model training, and evaluation.
  
- **`processdata.py`**: This script is responsible for processing the results generated by the main program, handling the output and calculating final metrics.
  
- **`requirements.txt`**: This file contains the list of Python packages and libraries required to run the project. Use this file to set up the environment by running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- **`eom_count/`**: This directory contains the scripts related to calculating sentiment polarity of textual data. It includes tools for emotion and sentiment analysis using advanced machine learning models.

## How to Run

1. Set up the environment by installing the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the main script by executing:
   ```bash
   bash main.sh
   ```

3. The results will be processed automatically, and final metrics can be evaluated using the `processdata.py` script.

## Features

- **Multimodal Learning**: Combines textual and visual data for few-shot learning using prompt-based methods.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporates an emotion and sentiment detection module located in the `eom_count/` folder.
- **Result Processing**: Provides detailed metrics and outputs using the result processing script `processdata.py`.
